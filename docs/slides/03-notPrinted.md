<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 90%"  -->
## This slide is not printed

Because of `excludeLocation="print-pdf"` in `index.html`.

See [print view](?print-pdf#/)

By the way, 

* the other way round also works, using `includeLocation`.
* Note that `location` is evaluated as regex!
* See [index.html](https://github.com/cloudogu/reveal.js-docker/blob/master/index.html) for implementation details.
* To hide parts of a slide in printing use `class="state-background"`.
